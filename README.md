KPaulson Autoplot Scripts

For the most part, these scripts can be downloaded and run through Autoplot's "Script" console or else run directly from their github source.

To run from Github, simply enter the script uri into the uri input box at the top of the autoplot canvas panel and hit enter. Any relevant gui input interfaces should automatically open. Be warned, not all codes have been tested to run independently from github, and may have my own local directories hard-coded. You are welcome to amend the routine to fit your needs.
